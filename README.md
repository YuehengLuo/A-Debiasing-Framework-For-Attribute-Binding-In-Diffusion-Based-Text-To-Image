# A-Debiasing-Framework-For-Attribute-Binding-In-Diffusion-Based-Text-To-Image

Official PyTorch implementation of the paper:  
**"A Debiasing Framework for Attribute Binding in Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image"**

## 📖 Overview

This repository provides the official implementation of our method proposed in the above paper.  
We present a debiasing framework that enhances attribute-object binding in diffusion-based text-to-image generation models.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.11.10  
- PyTorch 2.4.1+cu121  
- GPU: NVIDIA A800 

## 🔗 Reference Codebases

Our implementation is inspired by and built upon the following projects:

- [Magnet (I2-Multimedia-Lab)](https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/Magnet)  
- [Rare-to-Frequent (Krafton AI)](https://github.com/krafton-ai/Rare-to-Frequent)
